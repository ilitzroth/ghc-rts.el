#+TITLE: GHC RTS inside emacs

* Purpose
This code initializes the ghc rts inside emacs. It is used in an
upcoming package that allows one to write Haskell code that can be
called from emacs.
Reasons for this code as a standalone repo are two fold
** GHC RTS can only be initialized once
That means that we need to depend on a emacs lisp feature that will
not reload a module that is already loaded.

** Writing Haskell code for Emacs does not require C
The writer of Haskell code for Emacs does not have to mess around with
writing a stub module that initializes the RTS, he can just

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ghc-rts)
(ghc-rts-initialize)
#+END_SRC
